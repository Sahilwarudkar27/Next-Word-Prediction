📝 Next Word Prediction 

This is a **Next Word Prediction** web application built using **TensorFlow/Keras** and **Streamlit**. The app predicts the next few words in a sentence based on the text you provide, making it fun and interactive! ✨

---

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts the next **10 words** to complete your sentence.
- Friendly **user interface** with emojis and interactive buttons.
- Uses a **trained LSTM model** for text prediction.
- Supports **dynamic text input** from the user.
- Can be easily hosted online using Streamlit.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- Python 3.13.5  
- TensorFlow / Keras (LSTM Model)  
- Streamlit (Web interface)  
- NumPy  
- Pickle (for tokenizer)
